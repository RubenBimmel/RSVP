[Teunis]Sarah I thought I was clear when I told you to refrain from buying alcoholic substances. 
[Teunis]You know what Jan did to me?
[Teunis]I'm not even going to explain it. 
[Teunis]But it's not Jan's fault, it's yours alone.  
[Teunis]You don't have to come in on Monday.
[Teunis]You'll receive a letter about it.
